# Rough ongoing notes

excited to use golang in the back end, if it was nodejs I would be using the NestJS framework - it would be a lot quicker but I'd like to take this oppurtunity to learn and receieve feedback. 

# Tackling The Basics Part 1

Reading the tasks I'm focusing on the test criteria. Due to being unfamiliar with the language (I) I'd like to do the following first:
    - Research '2022 macbook golang setup'
    - Startin a simple hello world project but with go modules
    - Reviewing 'awesome' golang repositories to choose technologies
    - Chosen GIN as it is very popular (63k stars)
    - Implementing the api endpoints with gin - came into issue https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-go/issues/3234 (wtf)
    - Write the tests first from the specification. Testing both the inputs and the outputs criteria.
    - Focusing on the first endpoint in isolation (should make the rest easier)
    - Looking at https://docs.sqlc.dev/ to speed up the process of entity > database -> retrieval



Now the golang tests have been written and the skeleton project has been written
